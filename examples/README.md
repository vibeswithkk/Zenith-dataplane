# Zenith AI Examples

This directory contains example scripts demonstrating Zenith AI capabilities.

## Examples

### 1. Basic Usage (`demo_app.py`)

Demonstrates core Zenith engine functionality:
- Engine initialization
- Plugin loading
- Data publishing with zero-copy

```bash
python3 examples/demo_app.py
```

### 2. PyTorch Integration (`pytorch_example.py`)

Shows how to use Zenith with PyTorch for high-performance training:
- ZenithDataset and DataLoader
- Integration with standard training loops
- Performance comparison

```bash
pip install torch
python3 examples/pytorch_example.py
```

### 3. Filter Plugin Demo

The `filter.wasm` file is a sample WASM plugin that filters events.

## Data

The `data/` subdirectory contains sample datasets generated by the examples.

## Requirements

Basic:
```bash
pip install pyarrow numpy
```

With PyTorch:
```bash
pip install zenith-ai[torch]
# or
pip install torch pyarrow numpy
```

With TensorFlow:
```bash
pip install zenith-ai[tensorflow]
```

## Building from Source

If running examples in development mode:

```bash
# Build Rust core first
cd /path/to/Zenith-dataplane
cargo build --release

# Then run examples
python3 examples/demo_app.py
```
